# Company of Heroes 2 - Numerical Veterancy Description Mod

Project
------

> Have you ever wanted to know the numerical veterancy bonuses in game, without going to the [COH2.ORG guide](https://www.coh2.org/guides/29892/the-company-of-heroes-2-veterancy-guide)? Yeah! It's great that my rifleman receives `...more experience from extensive combat, increasing weapon lethality, increased durability, reducing ability recharge, and increasing ability range`, but how much exactly? I am glad that my riflemen got so much out of their extensive combat, but I WANT NUMBERS.
>
> Now you can get exact numbers in game with this great mod. It works in automatch too! With this mod, no more colourful and vague descriptions - only straight talk!
