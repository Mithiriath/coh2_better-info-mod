# Company of Heroes 2 - Better-Info-Mod

Project
------

> The "mod" is basically just a rewritten text file. Each text entry in the game has a unique key ID in that text file, and the associated text has been edited to be actually useful.
> 
> Company of Heroes 2 is a game full of units, abilities and mechanics. However, the UI's explanation of these is often vague or outdated. This leads to the fact that hardly anyone looks at the descriptions more than once, and those who want to know more details has to do research outside the game with sources that are often outdated themselves.
> 
> The mod takes descriptions of abilities, veterancy changes, units, build time, upgrades, aura buffs, damage dealt, etc. and replaces them with the most accurate, comprehensible values possible.
> 
> Now you will get accurate and actually helpful information by hovering your mouse over the respective icon, veteran star or unit descriptions in the lower part of the screen.
> 
> Here are some examples:

**Numerical Veterancy Description Mod**

> Have you ever wanted to know the numerical veterancy bonuses in game, without going to the [COH2.ORG guide](https://www.coh2.org/guides/29892/the-company-of-heroes-2-veterancy-guide)? Yeah! It's great that my rifleman receives `...more experience from extensive combat, increasing weapon lethality, increased durability, reducing ability recharge, and increasing ability range`, but how much exactly? I am glad that my riflemen got so much out of their extensive combat, but I WANT NUMBERS.
>
> Now you can get exact numbers in game with this great mod. It works in automatch too! With this mod, no more colourful and vague descriptions - only straight talk!
