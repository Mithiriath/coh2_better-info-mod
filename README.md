# Company of Heroes 2 - Numerical Veterancy Description Mod

Project
------

In CoH2 units have ambiguous or outdated veteran descriptions like: "Experienced crew improves combat performance."
The Mod replaces these texts with accurate values and/or mentions how abilities change. The goal here is to make game mechanics more transparent and to make it easier to understand the match-up between units.

The best part - it works in Multiplayer and replays and tells you the Vet-buffs of enemy and allied units.
