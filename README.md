# Company of Heroes 2 - Better-Info-Mod

Project
------

> Company of Heroes 2 is a strategy game full of units, abilities and mechanics and unfortunately their explanation often falls short, descriptions are often vague or outdated. As a result, most players dont bother to look at the in-game text info anymore and even experienced players still have to ask themselves questions like: `What does the Combined Arms ability actually do?`. Players who actually want to know more details have to look for them outside the game, with many of these guides and stat-websites being outdated themselves. We think a more accurate description makes game mechanics more transparent and can influence the decision making of casual as well as experienced players.
> 
> **What are the modification?**
>
> - Veterancy buffs are shown in the Vet-descriptions of all Units (aka *Numerical Veterancy Description Mod* - See section below).
> - HP and armor values are shown in the description of vehicles. Tanks and anti-tank guns additionally show damage as well as penetration.
> - Skills, Commander abilities, upgrades and small portrait icons (aura buffs, etc) were mostly replaced with more accurate descriptions.
> - Repair rates are shown in the descriptions of Engineers and their upgrades (minesweepers, etc.).
> - Damage to vehicles is shown in the descriptions of mines. Snares and anti-tank weapons for infantry additionally show penetration as well as range.
> - Time to complete tech upgrades and tech buildings is shown in their description.
> - Sight ranges are shown in the descriptions of infantry who can see beyond default 35 range.

**Numerical Veterancy Description Mod**

> Have you ever wanted to know the numerical veterancy bonuses in game, without going to the [COH2.ORG guide](https://www.coh2.org/guides/29892/the-company-of-heroes-2-veterancy-guide)? Yeah! It's great that my rifleman receives `...more experience from extensive combat, increasing weapon lethality, increased durability, reducing ability recharge, and increasing ability range`, but how much exactly? I am glad that my riflemen got so much out of their extensive combat, but I WANT NUMBERS.
>
> Now you can get exact numbers in game with this great mod. It works in automatch too! With this mod, no more colourful and vague descriptions - only straight talk!
